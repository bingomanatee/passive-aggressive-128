The seven parts of life cover birth, growing up, war, middle age, organ transplants, old age and death. Not all stages are singular: \"Part I: The Miracle of Birth\" is from the perspective of an ignored woman in labor, and of a Roman Catholic couple with too many children, and \"Part VII: Death\" encompasses a funeral and heaven. Added are three unrelated skits placed in the beginning, middle and end.","summary":"The British troupe (Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Terry Gilliam) spoofs gluttony, birth control.","html":"false","repeating":"true","category":"movie","area":"10001","start_time":"2013-10-20T21:00:00.000Z","all_day":"false","venue_name":"Frank Banko Alehouse Cinema","venue_id":"10425","times":[{"start_time":"2013-10-20 19:00","all_day":"false","area":"10001","venue_id":"10425","venue_name":"Frank Banko Alehouse Cinema"}]}
