She scrapes together as much money as she can and takes off for Austenland, a British theme resort where guests immerse themselves in a romantic fantasy worthy of Austen herself. However, because Jane's limited funds do not allow as many privileges as other guests, her chance at a fling with her very own Mr. Darcy may be limited as well.","summary":"An American spinster flies to England for the promise of romance at a Jane Austen-themed resort.","html":"false","repeating":"true","category":"movie","area":"10001","start_time":"2013-10-21T01:35:00.000Z","all_day":"false","venue_name":"Ambler Theater","venue_id":"1577","times":[{"start_time":"2013-10-20 23:35","all_day":"false","area":"10001","venue_id":"1577","venue_name":"Ambler Theater"},{"start_time":"2013-10-21 22:30","all_day":"false","area":"10001","venue_id":"1577","venue_name":"Ambler Theater"},{"start_time":"2013-10-22 22:30","all_day":"false","area":"10001","venue_id":"1577","venue_name":"Ambler Theater"},{"start_time":"2013-10-23 19:00","all_day":"false","area":"10001","venue_id":"1577","venue_name":"Ambler Theater"},{"start_time":"2013-10-24 01:00","all_day":"false","area":"10001","venue_id":"1577","venue_name":"Ambler Theater"},{"start_time":"2013-10-24 22:30","all_day":"false","area":"10001","venue_id":"1577","venue_name":"Ambler Theater"}]}
