When he's not dodging his followers or being scolded by his shrill mother (Terry Jones), the hapless Brian has to contend with the pompous Pontius Pilate (Michael Palin) and acronym-obsessed members of a separatist movement. Rife with Monty Python's signature absurdity, the tale finds Brian's life paralleling Biblical lore, albeit with many more laughs.","summary":"Mistaken for the Messiah, Brian (Graham Chapman) rocks Rome leading the Judean People's Front.","html":"false","repeating":"true","category":"movie","area":"10001","start_time":"2013-10-21T01:15:00.000Z","all_day":"false","venue_name":"Frank Banko Alehouse Cinema","venue_id":"10425","times":[{"start_time":"2013-10-20 23:15","all_day":"false","area":"10001","venue_id":"10425","venue_name":"Frank Banko Alehouse Cinema"}]}
